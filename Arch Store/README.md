Arch store is a terminal based python3 program that I made. 
It makes installation off the AUR and pacman and snap quick and painless with 'yay' for 32 and 64 bit computers. 

And VERY useful for arch linux beginners.
If you have any problems with it open a new issue, I try to respond quickly.


Instructions:

place the 'pkgmgr.py' file in your $HOME directory, and run it via terminal. 
Type 'FStart' and it will install all of the necessary packages. you can also type 'help' to see a list of commands. Enjoy.
